# Magic-Mote-Program

This program is designed to solve a "magic containment" problem, 
where you need to fit a given number of spherical objects 
(referred to as "motes") into cuboidal containers 
(referred to as "devices"). The goal is to minimize the total volume 
of motes that cannot be contained by any device. If a mote does not 
fit into any device, its volume contributes to the "uncontained volume."
